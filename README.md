Russian roulette game
How to play the game is in the game itself.
The goal of making this game was to reach my challenges and bugs in working with Python and it brought an interesting result. 
The noteworthy point in this game is the text of the game. The text of the game is connected to a library, and every time you play the game, you see a new text of the game.
In this program of libraries:
1) time
2) os
3) random
4) colorma
5) sys
